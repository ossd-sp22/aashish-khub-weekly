<b>Here is your assignment</b>
<blockquote>
For Tuesday, Sept 21, your assignment has
two parts.
<p>
Part 1 is to create a cool and interesting scene
using the 2D HTML canvas API that we used for Example2D,
using as reference:
	<a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp>HTML Canvas Reference</a>
<p>

Part 2 is to create a cool and interesting animated
pattern (or possibly scene)
using the 3D API that we introduced for
making things like marble and clouds (in Example3D).
All your work for this part can be in the fragment shader.
<p>
You can use as reference:
	<a href=https://www.khronos.org/files/webgl/webgl-reference-card-1_0.pdf>WebGL reference</a>

<p>

In each case, please paste your work directly into
files <code>js/Example2D.js</code>
and
<code>js/Example3D.js</code>, respectively.
<p>
For example, for Part 2 of the assignment, you should post your work on the fragment shader into
the <code>'fragment':</code> section of <code>code</code> within <code>js/Example3D.js</code>.
<p>
That is how the grader will be able to see your work. :-)
<p>
Remember to post your work to:
<code>&lt;YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY&gt;/graphics/hw1</code>
