	<h2> Computer Graphics Portfolio </h2>
  	<body bgcolor = "#FFFF2E">
	   	Hello, my name is Aashish and I study Physics and Computer Science at New York University! Welcome to my Computer Graphics course portfolio! <br>
		Keep checking this spot for any progress and updates! <br> 
		
		<h3><u>Assignment 0</u></h3>
		I'm interested in this course because I think it's pretty cool, looking forward to see how I can get creative with these tools! 
		<h3><u>Assignment 1</u> <a href = "./hw1/index.html">(link)</a></h3>
		Assignment 1 involved creating some 2D and 3D artwork. My 2D artwork is titled <i>The 8 a.m. Flower</i>, and my 3D artwork is titled <i>On the Transference of Dreams</i>. Both are linked <a href = "./hw1/index.html"> here.</a> 
		<h3><u>Assignment 2</u> <a href = "./hw2/index.html">(link)</a></h3>
                Assignment 2 involved shading some spheres using Phong Shading. It is linked <a href = "./hw2/index.html"> here.</a>
                
		<h3><u>Assignment 3</u> <a href = "./hw3/index.html">(link)</a></h3>
                Assignment 3 involved working with refraction and ray-tracing to intersections of quadric shapes. I created some abstract artwork titled <i>Abstract Geometric Orbits</i> involving revolving beads, since this allows the refraction to be observed quite well. It is linked <a href = "./hw3/index.html"> here.</a>

		<h3><u>Assignment 4</u> <a href = "./hw4/index.html">(link)</a></h3>

                Assignment 4 involved working with meshes and triangle strips in order to create complex shapes. In the spirit of Halloween, I created some artwork of a dancing skeleton called <i>Hally wishes you a Happy Halloween!</i>. This involved creating and modifying mesh strips for cylinders, cuboids, and tori. I also learned a lot about how different shapes were linked together, as this is what allowed the skeleton to dance. It is linked <a href = "./hw4/index.html"> here.</a>
		<h3><u>Assignment 5</u> <a href = "./hw5/index.html">(link)</a></h3>
                Assignment 5 involved working with splines of different types. For the first part of this assignment I decided to revisit my <i> The 8 a.m. Flower </i> artwork, and made something similar using BÃ©zier interpolation. My second one is a much cooler game of-sorts: it is <i> An Interactive Pottery Wheel</i>, which allows the user to design some pottery artwork in a box and observe the 3D pot on a spinning pottery wheel change in real-time. For this I used Catmull-Rom splines. It is linked <a href = "./hw5/index.html"> here.</a>
		<h3><u>Assignment 6</u> <a href = "./hw6/index.html">(link)</a></h3>
                Assignment 6 involved working with inverse kinematics and 3-Dimensional figures moving along a spline path. Some parameters were added to the figure provided. It is linked <a href = "./hw6/index.html"> here.</a>
		<h3><u>FINAL PROJECT</u> <a href = "./finproj/index.html">(link)</a></h3>
               For my Final Project, I created two dancing Skeletal figures named <i>Femur</i> and <i>Tibia</i>! I also parametrized and defined two 'dance modes', which I called "Pro Mode" and "Chicken Mode." This involved combining my results form Assignments 4, 5 and 6, and improving them even further by providing a spline-based choreography. I also learned a lot about the user-end design process by studying aesthetic aspects of my figures' motions. My work is linked <a href = "./finproj/index.html"> here.</a>
