<b>Introduction to homework 6</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
Homework 6, due on Tuesday November 30
before class,
is to build upon the walking character
that I started for you.
<p>
Depending on your interests, you can
go in a number of different directions.
For example, build
up from the waist, adding a torso
and a head -- and arms if you are feeling ambitious.
Or turn the pelvis into a head,
adding blinking eyes to create a character
somewhat like the one that I showed in class.
Or bend the knees backward to look like a walking bird (and maybe add a beak).
<p>
See if you can give your character personality
by using splines to control the movement over time of various parts.
For example, your character
can look with interest at one object and then at another.
Maybe tell a story. Be creative. Have fun with it.
<p>
<i>Extra credit:</i>
Give your character arms.
Use inverse kinematics to make the character
reach for an object.
The challenge here is placing the elbows.
Basically you are repurposing the <code>ik()</code>
function that I used to place knees between hips and ankles,
but instead you will be placing elbows between shoulders and wrists.
<p>
